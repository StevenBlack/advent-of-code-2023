# advent-of-code-2023

This is my setup for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).  This year I'll be coding in Rust again.  

I'm using the basic setup as described in [How to set up Rust for Advent of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=fEQv-cqzbPg) 
by Chris Biscardi.  Thanks Chris!
